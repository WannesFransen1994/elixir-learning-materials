# Elixir OTP

## Goal

In this course we'll cover the OTP aspects of Elixir. We assume that you've completed the [elixir-basics](https://github.com/WannesFransen1994/elixir-basics) course. The topics are listed under [Topics](#topics), which will be a short summary of what is covered in this repository.

## Usage

For this course we'll mostly still use the script method to complete the exercises. Later on, we'll move on to mix projects.

## Topics

- [X] Processes
- [X] Links, monitors
- [X] Tasks
- [X] GenServer
- [X] Supervisor

## Roadmap / missing topics

- [ ] Mix projects
- [ ] Observer

## Credit

Thanks to [Frederic Vogels](https://github.com/fvogels) for checking, creating and contributing to these exercises. Due to restructuring, the commits are no longer in the commit log, but will not be forgotten.

These exercises were originally created for the course Distributed Applications at [UCLL](https://www.ucll.be/). Most of this content is thus sponsored by UCLL.

Extra thanks to every contributor, student and the Elixir community.
